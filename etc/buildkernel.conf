EFIPARTUUID="bbe6ea66-16b7-5e41-995e-48ae3c955aa0"

# if your LUKS filesystem is NOT on a GPT partition (for example, if it is
# on an MBR partition, or if you have luksFormat-ed a top-level drive, rather
# than a partition within it), then you must uncomment and set the following
# variable (use "ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid" to locate the correct path)
# NB - most users will NOT need to do this (it is a special case), and
# should accordingly leave the variable commented out;
# note also that if you set CRYPTPATHMAP directly in this manner, the
# contents of CRYPTPARTUUID will be ignored

# if your LUKS keyfile is not on your EFI system partition (for example,
# because you use a USB key to hold the keyfile, but have created an EFI
# system partition on the machine's main drive), then uncomment the below
# and replace the UUID with the appropriate value (find with lsblk and blkid)
# for your system; if you do not, then KEYFILEPARTUUID=EFIPARTUUID is assumed
#KEYFILEPARTUUID="8eca6e85-3f96-4117-b1f0-864576258c4f"

# if you wish to rely only on the fallback passphrase (assuming you have set

# by default, buildkernel will build the kernel in /usr/src/linux. If
# LINUXBUILDDIR is specified, buildkernel will delete the contents of
# LINUXBUILDDIR/buildkernel, copy the contents of /usr/src/linux there,
# then build the kernel in that directory. This can be useful for sparing write
# cycles if /usr/src/linux is located on a SSD and the specified directory lies
# e.g. on tmpfs.

# by default, genkernel will be instructed to include all firmware and modules
# into the initramfs; uncomment and change the below (for example, to specify
# an empty string) if you do not want this, or if you want to manage these
# options explicitly through /etc/genkernel.conf
# (caution - may cause boot issues on some systems)

# by default, buildkernel will ensure that an EFI boot entry for any kernel
# it creates exists at the top of the EFI boot order (in EFI NVRAM);
# uncomment and change the below (to specify value 0) if you do not want to
# do this (for example, because you wish to use your own EFI bootloader)
